* Space Age

Space Age is a Gemini server written in Clojure (https://clojure.org/).

It implements Gemini protocol specification v0.14.3 (November 29th
2020), which can be found here:

  gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi

This is a forked/updated version of the server, for use with [[https://github.com/loopdreams/gemini-games-scripts][gemini-game-scripts]]. The code here is from the original server, with an additional database related namespace.

I've left this repository here for anyone interested in the code behind my gemini games, but if you are looking for a functioning server, its better to go look at the original version.
