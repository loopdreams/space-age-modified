## Info

### Starting/Joining a Game

This is a two-player version of chess. To start a game, go to the "Start Game" link and choose your starting colour. Then, wait for an opponent to join.

You can view active games under the Active Games page. If you wish to join a game that someone has started, navigate here and join a game under the Open Games heading. You can spectate other people's games under the Running Games heading.

### Playing

When inputting moves, you should use standard chess notation:

- When moving a pawn, you can simply refer to the destination square, e.g., e5
- When moving other pieces, you have to prefix the destination square with the piece name, e.g., Nf3 - move the Knight to f3

Piece names:
- K - King
- Q - Queen
- R - Rook
- B - Bishop
- N - Knight

- When castling, enter '0-0' for kingside castling and '0-0-0' for queenside castling
- For promotions, enter the piece you wish to promote to after the destination square (e.g., a8Q)

In some cases, more than one piece can move to the desired location. In these cases you will have to input the full coordinates for the move, for example:

- Pawn move disambiguated: e7e5
- Other piece move disambiguated: Ng1f3

Note: disambiguation using rank or file only (e.g., Ngf3) is not currently supported.

You can resign or offer a draw via the links on the game page. If you offer a draw the other player can accept/reject.

Once a game is finished, you can access it from your user profile on the home page.

### The Board

Games are displayed using a very minimal interface. White pieces are lower-case and black pieces are upper-case.

I'm open to suggestions with regard to improving this visually. At the moment it isn't ideal, but perhaps if you have a chess board at home you can set one up to help with thinking through moves.

During the game, the history of moves is also output below the board, so you can always copy these into another chess viewer to get a better picture of the board.
