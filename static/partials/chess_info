## Info

### Starting/Joining a Game

This is a two-player version of chess. To start a game, go to the "Start Game" link and choose your starting colour. Then, wait for an opponent to join.

You can view active games under the Active Games page. If you wish to join a game that someone has started, navigate here and join a game under the Open Games heading. You can spectate other peoples games under the Running Games heading.

### Playing

When inputting moves, you should use standard chess notation:

- When moving a pawn, you can simply refer to the destination square, e.g., e5
- When moving other pieces, you have to prefix the destination square with the piece name, e.g., Nf3 - move the Knight to f3

Piece names:
- K - King
- Q - Queen
- R - Rook
- B - Bishop
- N - Knight

- When castling, enter '0-0' for kingside castling and '0-0-0' for queenside castling
- For promotions, enter the piece you wish to promote to after the destination square (e.g., a8Q)

In some cases, more than one piece can move to the desired location. In these cases you will have to input the full coordinates for the move, for example:

- Pawn move disambiguated: e7e5
- Other piece move disambiguated: Ng1f3

Note: disambiguation using only rank or file only (e.g., Ngf3) is not currently supported.

You can resign or offer a draw via the links on the game page. If you offer a draw the other player can accept/reject.

Once a game is finished, you can access it from your user profile on the home page.
